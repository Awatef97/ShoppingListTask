# ShoppingListTask

An Android app that allows users to create and manage a simple shopping list.

Feat:-
---

I implement this task using: Kotlin and following Model-view-viewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern that follows separation of concerns.
Also by applying Clean Architecture to ensure maintainable and scalable systems.

The following technologies are used:

- ViewModel to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
- Dagger-hilt library to do dependency injection and reducing the boilerplate code.
- Kotlin coroutines for doing work on the background thread and communicating to the main thread.
- Operators are used to give control on and manipulating the emitted flows.
- Room database for cashing.
